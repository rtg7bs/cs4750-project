The act released New Jeans on August 1, 2022, instantly captivating the global audience and becoming the first K-pop band to achieve the million-seller milestone with their debut album. One of the lead singles "Hype Boy” charted on Billboard Global 200 for 37 consecutive weeks– the longest record from any K-pop female act. Since then, a total of five tracks have marked their places on Billboard Hot 100 including global smash hits "Ditto,” "OMG,” and "Super Shy,” while their 2nd EP Get Up debuted at the top of Billboard 200. As the K-pop act to reach one billion streams on Spotify within the shortest period of time since debut, NewJeans currently holds more than 4.4 billion streams and more than 6.4 million album sales to their name. The band continues to make history with their show stopping performances, gracing the stages of Chicago’s Lollapalooza and the League of Legends World Championship Finals in 2023, both as the first K-pop female group to do so.'),
(2, 'League of Legends', 'An internationally popular multiplayer online battle arena video game, League of Legends was created in 2009 by Riot Games. Commonly called "League," the game and its myriad offshoots include music videos, comic books, short stories, and the animated series Arcane. In 2014, Riot''s in-house music team created the virtual heavy metal group Pentakill, a League tie-in project that included cameos from Tommy Lee and Danny Lohner. The band''s 2017 album, Grasp of the Undying, was a streaming hit. K/DA, a virtual K-pop girl group, also League adjacent, was partially created to promote a skin line of the same name. The group went viral with their 2018 debut single, "Pop/Stars," which amassed millions of online views, garnering interest from listeners unfamiliar with its gaming origins. In 2019, Riot unveiled a virtual hip-hop group, True Damage, with the single "Giants." The following year saw KDA issue its debut EP, All Out, and in 2021 the company released the soundtrack for the League of Legends animated series Arcane.

(3, 'JID', 'Born and raised in East Atlanta, J.I.D -- a name adopted and adapted from what his grandmother called him as a jittery child -- first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, Dicaprio, in 2015. Growing up, J.I.D''s first connection with music was through his parents'' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, J.I.D also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EARTHGANG, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed J.I.D to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the Dicaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EARTHGANG. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, J.I.D wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, J.I.D, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J.Cole''s Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via J.I.D''s part in the 2014 tour with Bas and J.Cole''s friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. ~ Rich Wilson, Rovi'),
(4, 'Jon Batiste', 'Jon Batiste is widely recognized as "a certified musical genius” (The Guardian). As an American composer, pianist, singer, bandleader, educator, producer, and cultural ambassador who "actively promotes the normalization of musical ambidexterity” (Downbeat), he has worked with artists ranging from classical legends Andrea Bocelli, Hilary Hahn, Lang Lang, Yo-Yo Ma, and Itzhak Perlman to pop and jazz icons Beyoncé, Prince, and Herbie Hancock. Batiste’s many honors include five Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and an Oscar. Showcasing his improvisatory transformations of some of Beethoven’s most iconic works, Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1) was released in November 2024 by Verve Records / Interscope. Beethoven Blues follows the success of his two most recent studio albums. World Music Radio (2023) received four Grammy nominations, including one for "Album of the Year.” Similarly, We Are (2021) made Grammy history, receiving eleven Grammy nominations in seven different categories, before winning "Album of the Year” and four more. Immersed since early childhood in New Orleans'' rich musical heritage, Batiste trained as a classical pianist and received both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in piano from New York’s Juilliard School.

(7, 'Laufey', '"As a musician, my goal is to bring jazz and classical music to my generation,” declares GRAMMY-winning composer, singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Laufey. In 2022, the Icelandic-Chinese artist’s trailblazing approach paid off, with a performance on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE! in support of her debut album Everything I Know About Love, sold out tours of North America, Asia, and Australia, and she was the most streamed jazz artist on Spotify. The Los Angeles-based Laufey (pronounced l?y-v?y) continued her story by writing and recording Bewitched, her second album. Inspired by jazz greats and classical masters while possessing a point of view that could only be conveyed by a 21st-century twentysomething, Bewitched represents an expansion of Laufey’s sonic palette. Tracks like the breezy bossa nova cut "From the Start” and the smoldering string-assisted ballad "Promise” have classic songcraft and intricate arrangements that make them feel instantly timeless, while Laufey’s conversational lyrics give her music a relatability to the next generation of jazz and classical aficionados. The album has gone on to break the record as the biggest debut for a jazz album on Spotify in history and earned a 2024 GRAMMY win for "Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album." Laufey’s self-assured musicianship and deeply felt lyrics take the idea of "classic” music, whether it’s slotted as classical or jazz—or even chart-topping pop—and humanize it, creating a deep-seated connection.'),

Based in London, but with residencies in cities throughout England and a thriving international touring programme and global digital reach, the Philharmonia engages with a world-wide audience. As one of the world’s most recorded orchestras, the Philharmonia’s international recognition and reputation in part derives from its extraordinary recording legacy, which in the last 10 years has been burnished by digital and technological innovation. The Orchestra now records and releases music across multiple channels and media. An app for iPad, The Orchestra, has sold tens of thousands of copies. Film composers including Marvel soundtrack composer Brian Tyler choose to record their Hollywood scores with the Orchestra.

For the recording of Fantasy Gateway, Cuco planted himself in his parents’ native land of Mexico, specifically Mexico City, to explore all his selves—song by song. "I’ve always been an imaginative person, and found nostalgia alluring,” he continues.”I remember memories that never existed, things that I never lived, things I have lived, and I think of the future as a past memory. That’s the fantasy gateway for me: being in a perfect place, but feeling discomfort.” Sonically, Cuco brought on a trusted group of producers, who as a collective while in Mexico City, explored the concept behind Fantasy Gateway. Manuel Lara, Venezuelan producer, songwriter, and engineer (Bad Bunny, Kali Uchis), was one of the producers enlisted to bless Fantasy Gateway, alongside Andres Rebellón, Julian Bernal, and Ian Fitchuk (Kacey Musgraves).'),

These accolades proved to be no fluke, as SZA earned almost as many Grammy nominations the next year by assisting Kendrick Lamar with "All the Stars," a Top Ten hit, only one in a slew of platinum singles she has scored as a headliner or featured artist.

(26, 'Travis Scott', 'Houston-born rapper and producer Travis Scott''s psychedelic trap style makes him one of the more distinctive talents to have risen to the height of mainstream commercial popularity. His heavily processed, half-sung/half-rapped style set him apart early on, and he grew from affiliations with ''s GOOD Music and ''s  in the early 2010s to chart-dominating popularity before the close of the decade. After his first studio album, 2015''s Rodeo, debuted in the number three position, Scott followed with a pair of number one full-lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018), all the while assisting on platinum singles headlined by the likes of Rihanna ("Bitch Better Have My Money"), SZA ("Love Galore"), and Drake ("Portland"), and working extensively with Quavo as Huncho Jack. Whether leading or supporting, Scott''s presence was unmistakable, and he quickly accumulated Grammys, endorsement deals, and appearances in more than 80 charting songs. By the 2020s, Scott was one of the most successful living artists on the planet. This level of fame played into both extreme success and profound tragedy, with Scott being at the center of controversy surrounding the deaths and injuries of hundreds of fans at his 2021 Astroworld festival before debuting his genre-crossing, Grammy-nominated fourth album, 2023''s UTOPIA.

Remarkably, those qualities were exemplified in their Top 40 singles, including "Swimming Pools (Drank)," "i," and the number one hit "HUMBLE." among a total of seven the albums produced. Lamar''s screenplay-level detail of writing on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of producers, instrumentalists, singers, and rappers, many of whom -- from inspirations Dr. Dre and MC Eiht to peers such as Sounwave, Terrace Martin, and Thundercat -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper''s cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the source of three additional Top 40 singles. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense self-analysis, became Lamar''s sixth consecutive chart-topping project despite containing his most challenging and confrontational work.

Outside of school and familial extracurriculars, Swae would experiment with production, recording software, and learn how to mix audio.

Yet, as his most recent project, Big Fish Theory, suggests, appearances can be deceiving. The LP delves into the confusion of sudden fame and acclimating to a lifestyle antithetical to the one he’d known in Long Beach – one wrought with gang violence and poverty. It’s a fundamental narrative in hip hop, but rappers have always found a new way to breathe life into it. Staples brings forth a vision that’s brutal, elegant, playful, and despondent in one breath. Such is the nature of his music, as self and socially aware as it is comical. With Prima Donna and Summertime ’06 behind him, Staples has set the tone for what’s yet to come. A standout rapper in today’s hip hop world, he keeps his sound deeply tied to his west coast roots and his message one that knows no boundaries.

Representing Watts with his lucid and gruff narratives, he''s a Top Dawg linchpin whose solo discography is studded with the Top 20 albums 90059 (2015) and Redemption (2018). The latter full-length holds "Win," a highly motivational song nominated for a Grammy the same year he and labelmate Kendrick Lamar took the award for Best Rap Performance with the multi-platinum single "King''s Dead." Jay Rock has since returned from a lengthy absence with "Eastside," an anthemic prelude to his fourth proper album.'),
(62, 'Future', 'Chart-topping and influential rapper Future is known for a uniquely fluid and melodic yet mumbling vocal style. He busted out of the South at the dawn of the 2010s with a flurry of mixtapes, high-charting albums, certified platinum singles, and contributions to several other hits as a featured artist, then continued to hover at the top of his game, both commercially and creatively, in the years that followed. After he scored his first hit via a guest spot on YC''s "Racks" (2011), Future quickly became a key factor in Atlanta''s grip on the Billboard charts, often with production support from fellow ATL natives and dwellers such as Metro Boomin, Mike WiLL Made-It, Sonny Digital, and Southside. By the end of 2017, Future had amassed 32 Top Ten R&B/hip-hop hits as a headliner and featured artist. Meanwhile, 11 full-length projects -- including an all-platinum run of DS2 (2015), Evol (2016), and Future (2017) -- debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200. Future capped off the 2010s by adding to his Top 20 tally with the Grammy-winning "King''s Dead," co-producing a remake of Super Fly, and hitting the top of the Billboard 200 again with The Wizrd (2019). He has since returned to the throne with several projects, including High Off Life (2020), WE DON''T TRUST YOU/WE STILL DON''T TRUST YOU (with Metro Boomin, 2024), and Mixtape Pluto (2024).'),
(63, 'Zacari', 'Singer, songwriter, rapper, and multi-instrumentalist Zacari has a wide-ranging sound that can move swiftly from aching R&B to laid-back electronics-fused hip-hop. A feature on Kendrick Lamar''s DAMN. took Zacari from being a relatively lesser-known artist to being connected with a chart-topping masterpiece, and from there he signed on with Top Dawg Entertainment for the release of projects like his 2019 EP Run Wild Run Free, 2021''s SOL, and his 2024 full-length debut, Bliss.'),
(64, 'Babes Wodumo', 'Singer and choreographer Babes Wodumo is one of the first true celebrities to emerge from Durban, South Africa''s gqom scene, and has drawn international attention to the style. Her sweet yet commanding vocals add a more accessible edge to gqom''s tense, hypnotic sound, which resembles a more stripped-down, polyrhythmic variation on the more house-derived style known as kwaito. She broke through with the 2016 single "Wololo," included on her debut album, Gqom Queen, Vol. 1, and was nominated for numerous awards. This led to an appearance on the Black Panther soundtrack (2018) and a collaboration with Major Lazer, furthering her global reach. While Wodumo''s personal life often seems to garner more attention than her music, she has continued issuing music and collaborating with South African artists, remaining a strong presence in the entertainment world.'),
(65, 'Mozzy', 'Mozzy has emerged as one of the most exciting voices coming out of the West Coast. From Sacramento’s Oak Park neighborhood, the prolific EMPIRE artist reached the mainstream after appearing on 2018’s #1 Grammy-nominated Black Panther soundtrack. After a host of celebrated albums, collaborative projects, and massive hits on YouTube spanning a decade, Mozzy steps forth with his most compassionate album to date, Beyond Bulletproof. Supporting others is at the heart of 2020’s Beyond Bulletproof. "In my neighborhood and the ghettos of America, ‘bulletproof’ means ‘love.’ So this is a message that nobody can tamper with the love that I’ve got for you; it’s bulletproof—it’s Teflon. We seasoned up the expression; I’m taking it further, and saying that I love you—regardless of your flaw or the rules of the street.” In several places on the album, Mozzy looks at those who are bullied or passed over in their community—whether due to addiction, poverty, or mistakes they made in the past. It offers a hand, a second chance, and some understanding. "I Ain’t Perfect” is one such song, marking some new depth for the ever-evolving rapper. "We overlook the people that hit rock bottom, but I endure the same struggles and go through the same problems. The only difference is I’m functioning. I’m still able to go to work, pay my bills, and keep things in order. But I have the same problems where I fall on my face.” Mozzy hopes to shine a light on the unsung heroes.'),
(66, 'Sjava', 'Blending hip-hop, R&B, and African pop styles, Sjava became one of South Africa''s most successful artists during the second half of the 2010s. Singing and rapping almost entirely in Zulu, he writes emotionally resonant sounds about relationships and family matters, and his songs effortlessly demonstrate how much common ground contemporary R&B and trap have with traditional Zulu musical forms. After breaking through with his gold-selling debut album, 2016''s Isina Muva, his fame spread internationally when he was featured on the Black Panther soundtrack in 2018.'),
(67, 'REASON', 'REASON, born Robert Gill Jr., is an American rapper hailing from Carson, California. With his distinctive flow and thought-provoking lyrics, REASON has made a name for himself in the hip-hop industry.

REASON''s journey in the music industry began to gain traction with the release of his mixtape "The Free Album" in 2016, which showcased his raw talent and introspective storytelling. However, it was his signing to the renowned label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2018 that propelled his career to new heights. Since then, REASON has collaborated with TDE heavyweights like Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolboy Q, solidifying his place among the elite rap artists of his generation. With his lyrical prowess and a commitment to authenticity, REASON continues to captivate audiences and establish himself as a voice for the underrepresented, making him a force to be reckoned with in the rap game.'),

Two years later, "Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)” won "Best R&B Performance” & received an Academy Award nod for "Best Original Song” & 4X Platinum Beauty Behind The Madness won a GRAMMY for "Best Urban Contemporary Album.” In 2018, Starboy won the same award, making him the 1st artist ever to win twice.

(69, 'Chance the Rapper', 'Despite his evasion of stylistic pigeonholing and no label affiliation -- not even a major-bankrolled vanity imprint -- Chance the Rapper is one of the most significant independent artists to infiltrate the mainstream. Through several mixtapes, his output underwent a rapid evolution as he celebrated life and faith, mourned personal losses, and hit upon lighter everyday experiences with high-aptitude wordplay served with a variety of mostly genial styles. All the while, the productions that supported the verses and hooks included various regional contemporary rap production styles, and among other genres synthesized elements of gospel, jazz, and soul. Previously unthinkable achievements, such as winning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album with 2016''s Coloring Book -- a mixtape available only on streaming platforms -- prompted headlines, yet they didn''t overshadow the creative accomplishments that vaulted him onto the top tier. Chance continued to evolve with the delivery of his long-awaited debut studio album, 2019''s The Big Day. He has stayed busy, collaborating on tracks with Ludacris, Justin Bieber, Vic Mensa, and others while building up to the release of his 2024 mixtape Star Line Gallery.'),

Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011''s Take Care to 2018''s trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning "Hotline Bling" and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring the Weeknd''s early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake''s constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world''s most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022''s Honestly, Nevermind and 2023''s For All the Dogs became cultural events.

His top hits span over a decade and include Drake, Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper, and Rihanna among the eager featured artists.
